# Customer-Segmentation-Using-Clustering
in this project i created customer segmentation model for clustering our customers in to groups so that we can target them individually.


        Data 


dataset available in kaggle with the name "Customer segmentation" also shared it with in this repository.


       ALGORITHM
     
     
used KMeans clustering which is a a decent algorithm for such kind of problem.



      Important terms to remember



Clustering
KMeans
make-pipline
Inertia
silhouette_score
Variance
Principal Component Analysis(PCA)


notbook is organized in such a way that first make clustering only using 2 features from the dataset then visualizing the output .
after the above model increase our features to 5 to get better results and finally use PCA for reducing our futures to 2 for visualization.


IF U GUYS HAVE ANY FEEDBACK HAPPY TO ACCEPT.
